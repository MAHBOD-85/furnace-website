open benefits

the entire community wins!
by being free and open-source, this means that you can contribute new demo songs, improvements, fixes and a lot more.

learn how Furnace works!
look at the inner workings of the Furnace engine. discover the magic of its GUI code.

trust the software you use!
you can inspect/audit the entire code and prove it is free of malware.

make your own Furnace!
you can adapt it to your specific use case. some examples are retro game development and interfacing with hardware.

make it run everywhere!
while the official releases target Windows, macOS and Linux (x86_64), Furnace's code is portable and therefore you're able to get it working under other operating systems with little to no modifications.
for example: Unix/Unix-like (BSD, AIX, Solaris, QNX, etc.), Android, iOS, OS/2, Haiku, AmigaOS and many others!

if you're not sure, what are you waiting for?
Furnace will be free (as in freedom, and as in free beer) forever. it's a project made by many expert volunteers in their free times.

I would like to thank everyone for your contributions to this project!
